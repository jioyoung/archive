# Logistic Regression
> Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function. It's an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits. 

The function is defined by $$c^2$$

```python {cmd=true matplotlib=true}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3, 4])
plt.show() # show figure
```
