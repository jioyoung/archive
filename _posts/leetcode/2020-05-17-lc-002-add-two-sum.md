#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes
# contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
# 
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

# Definition for singly-linked list.

#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
```

## Algorithm
1. iteration from the two linked list one by one until both vals are null
2. pay attention to the sum of value when it is greater than 9 (10, 11 ....)
3. when all elements are processed in the two linked lists, check if 1 is needed to add to the last position




```python
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        # check if the sum is greater than 9
        # iterate until one list is empty
        cur = head = ListNode(0)
        value = 0
        while l1 or l2:
            if l1:
                value += l1.val
                # do not forget to update l1 or l2
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                value += l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
                
            if value > 9:
                cur.next = ListNode(value-10)
                cur = cur.next
                value = 1
            else:
                cur.next = ListNode(value)
                cur = cur.next
                value = 0
        
        # add 1 if the previous sum is greater than 9
        if value == 1:
            cur.next = ListNode(1)

        return head.next
```
