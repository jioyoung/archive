Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
not use the same element twice.

Example:


Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

The idea is to use dictionary with key equal to (target-nums[i]) and value equal to the index i. Once the nums[j]
is found in the dictionary, then the two-sum pair is found.


```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # use dictionary
        # diff between value and target is the key of the dict
        num_dict = dict()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in num_dict:
                num_dict[target-nums[i]] = i
            else:
                return [num_dict[nums[i]], i]
```
